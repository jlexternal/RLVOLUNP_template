<--------Exporting files to CSV from the mySQL database------->

When trying to export results of queries from the database into a CSV, one might use something like :

  mysql> SELECT * FROM main_table INTO OUTFILE 'out/test.csv' FIELDS ENCLOSED BY '"' TERMINATED BY ';' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';

Which then may have different types of errors.

1/ One error might be that you don't have permission to write to some directory (prevented by mySQL).
To fix, check

  mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "secure_file_priv";

and see what directory that is assigned to. If you want to change it to write it anywhere, that must be set to NULL or "" within /etc/my.cnf
as such:

  > sudo vim /etc/my.cnf

then enter

  [mysqld]
  secure_file_priv=""

and save.

2/ Another type of error is that you do not have permission to write from an SQL database into your local directories via the OS.
To fix, allow this privilege.

Find the location of where data is written from mySQL:

  > mysql -u root -p -e 'SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_Name="datadir"'

Then check the owner of each file/folder

  > ls -lh /usr/local/var/mysql/

You may see that it is _mysql as the owner of most if not all these files. Change them to the OS admin (or other):

  > sudo chown -R _mysql:admin /usr/local/var/mysql/*
